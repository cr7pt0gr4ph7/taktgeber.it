  I'm a software engineer with a broad experience with different languages, tools and frameworks.
  I am interested in practically anything related to software development and architecture.
  My main focus are managed languages, including C#, Go, Ruby, Python, Java&shy;Script/&#8203;Type&shy;Script
  &mdash; although I can deal with C/&#8203;C++ code if needed, and can read most other languages as well.

  In my professional work, I have:
  - been responsible for integrating new hardware products into an industrial desktop configuration tool,
  - worked a lot with C#/.NET and XAML/WPF,
  - automated JVM-related builds with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [Git&shy;Lab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/),
  - orchestrated large .NET builds with [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/), MSBuild and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/),
  - designed and developed static websites, and deployed them using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
  - become quite experienced with [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
  - automated personal workflows using [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/),
  - wrote a small web scraper,
  - experimented with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/),
  - programmatically created Development VMs using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/),
  - worked with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (although only at small scales),
  - written an [IDE extension for IntelliJ IDEA](https://github.com/cr7pt0gr4ph7/thymeleaf-extras-idea-plugin),
  - written [parsers](https://github.com/cr7pt0gr4ph7/thymeleaf-extras-idea-plugin/blob/master/grammar/Grammar.bnf) for said IDE extension

  ...and a lot of other stuff.

  I'm also an avid dancer and professional [dance teacher](https://tanzgefuehl.dance/)
  &ndash; the latter of which has taught me a lot about how people learn, and how to keep them motivated.
